        <p style="font-family: roboto; line-height: 150%; font-size:14px;">
            Towards the start of my career, I would like to be something like a product amanger at a large tech company. Eventually, I want to climb higher in the ranks, and lead the company or a subsidary. <br><br>
            If I don't want to work at a company like that, I will probably launch my own startup and lead it as the CEO. I know that I want to combine my passion for business and computer science in a way that 
            makes me proud of myself, while keeping myself happy.
        </p>
        <h2 style = "font-size: 200%; color: navy; font-family: elsie;">College Plans</h1>
        <p style="font-family: roboto; line-height: 150%; font-size:14px;">
            I want a major in computer science and a minor in business. I want to go to Stanford because they have a great business school, and a great computer science program. <br><br>
            My alternative is getting a masters in computer science, and working for a while before coming back to get an MBA. I could also try to get into the MET program at UC Berkeley to 
            get a double major in business and comp sci. I would also love to go to Carnegie Mellon University for Computer Science. If I take a break between business and comp sci, I would probably try to go to a 
            university near me, so if I'm in california, I'll try to go to Stanford. If I'm in the east Coast, schools like NYU, Harvard, or maybe Wharton would be a better idea for the MBA.
